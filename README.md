This project is my solution to the classic [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
- **Dataset:** Provided by Kaggle, includes passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.
- **Tech stack:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

## What’s Inside

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Generating a submission file for Kaggle

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `Titanic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Follow along with the code and explanations
4. Try modifying models or features to improve accuracy
